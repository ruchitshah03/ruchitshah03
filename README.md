- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ruchit Shah, graduate student at the University of Toronto. 
- I'm currently working on the aerodynamic optimization project where the effect of scaling of design variables is observed. For this study, the geometric design variables like twist, section shape and chord are scaled by the multiple combination of factor of 10 and 1. Another project I am working on was to analyse the sentiment of tweet for the canadian election 2019 using the machine learning algorithms in python and using the pakages pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn, regex, and xgboost.
 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in aerodynamic and structural design and algorithm development that includes optimization and simulation analysis. Moreover, it fascinates me to work on the data analytics where I can implement the python script with different libraries to predict the anticipated outcome. 
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning FORTRAN and C++ which is implemented for the aerodynamic shape optimization with drag minimization on the HPC platform. Also, learning the data science model development participating in the kaggle competition.
