- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ruchit Shah, graduate student at the University of Toronto.
 
- I have worked on various data science and machine learning projects in Python including the Sentiment analysis, Kaggle competition on Recommendation system and other classification projects. 

- I am interested in pursuing skills in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. Learning more and more with the data and to analyse it for the betterment of the industries is the main passion. Moreover, it fascinates me to work on the data analytics where I can implement the python script with different libraries to predict the anticipated outcome. 
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning FORTRAN and C++ which is implemented for the aerodynamic shape optimization with drag minimization on the HPC platform. Also, learning the data science model development participating in the kaggle competition. 

- ðŸ“š List of Projects accomplished:
- Simulation and Analysis Projects:
- Data Science Projects:
- Design and Manufacturing Projects:
